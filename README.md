# [The Great Gift Ranking ðŸ§¢](https://adventofsql.com/challenges/12)

## Description
Santa faced a growing challenge: childrenâ€™s increasingly diverse wish lists made it harder to identify the most beloved gifts. Mrs. Claus proposed tracking each gift's relative popularity to uncover true trends. Using a magical scroll ranking items, Santa discovered that warm winter hats were the season's top choice, surpassing the usual demand for electronics.

This revelation allowed Santa to refocus his workshop's production efforts on what mattered most. With a newfound appreciation for simple joys, he watched his elves craft hats with care, confident that this ranking system would help him adapt to changing trends and deliver more happiness to children worldwide.
